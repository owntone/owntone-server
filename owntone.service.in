# Constrain the upper limit of memory/swap that can be used; this prevents 
# the server from consuming all system memory (in event of bug/malformed user
# curl/SMARTPL query etc) that would hang/freeze low resource and headless (ie 
# RPi) machines
#
# systemd will kill the process in such an event but would be auto-restarted as
# per 'Restart' directive below
#
# Values derived from obersvations on rpi3 under load - limits are >50% above
# seen high watermarks 
# 
# https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html
MemoryMax=256M
MemorySwapMax=32M

# Restart, but set a limit so we don't restart indefinitely. Unfortunately,
# systemd also applies the start limits to manual restarts, so that's why the
# burst value allows for 10 restarts.
