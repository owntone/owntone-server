WHAT IS AVLTREE?

AVLTree is a small implementation of AVL trees for the C programming
language.  It is distributed under the Library GNU Public License.

This library does the basic stuff. It allows for inserts, searches, and
deletes in O(log n) time. It also allows the tree to be used as a linked
indexable list (search/insert functions cannot be used in that case).

If you find a bug, you should mail Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>,
who produced this version of the library and therefore is to blame.

The original author is Michael H. Buselli <cosine@cosine.org>, who can

COMPILING THE LIBRARY

There is a Makefile included in the distribution.

USING THE LIBRARIES

There are no real usage documents yet. Look at avl.h (you need to
include these headers in your programs to use the library) to see what
functions and structures are available. As a small example:

	#define BUFSIZE 8192

	int main(void) {
		char *buf[BUFSIZE];
		AVLTree *tree;
		AVLTree *node;

		tree = avl_alloc_tree((avl_compare_t)strcmp, (avl_freeitem_t)free);

		while(fgets(buf, BUFSIZE, stdin))
			avl_insert(tree, strdup(buf));

		for(node = tree->head; node; node = node->next)
			printf("%s", node->item);

		avl_free_tree(tree, free);
	}

A real implementation would check the return values of avl_alloc_tree,
avl_insert and strdup of course.

HISTORY

Version 0.1.0 (alpha):
	This is the initial alpha version of AVLTree.  It's already fully
	functional for many applications, including the one that I developed it
	for.  I've only tested it on my Linux 2.0.35/glibc2 system, so I have no
	idea what it will do anywhere else so far.  Let me know if you have good
	results or bad if you try a platform that I don't mention above.

    This version is considered alpha because it does not yet contain
	all of the features that I plan for version 1.0.0.  It should not
	contain any bugs as it is.

Version 0.2.0 2000-11-28 Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>
	Modifications to support fast traversal and accessing by index.
	The tree is generalized to allow arbitrary comparison functions.
	Fixed bug: when deleting, in some cases rebalancing would not occur

Version 0.3.0 2001-01-07 Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>
	Tree can now be balanced on count or depth (but depth works better).
	Fixed bug: balancing on count now is done correctly.

Version 0.3.1 2001-07-17 Wessel Dankers <wsl@nl.linux.org>
	Node initialization is moved to make matters a bit more robust

Version 0.3.4 2002-06-11 Wessel Dankers <wsl@fruit.eu.org>
	Fixed a bug in the node counting.

Version 0.3.5 2002-11-15 Wessel Dankers <wsl@fruit.eu.org>
	Added avl_node_fixup() and avl_clear_tree().
	Removed obsolete files from source tree.
