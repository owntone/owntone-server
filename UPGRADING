Upgrading
---------

From time to time, newer versions of OwnTone may need to perform a database
upgrade. This upgrade is handled by the server upon startup if required.

Before upgrading the server, it is always a good idea to backup your database,
just in case.

The database upgrade procedure is built into the server; there is no external
upgrade script to run. Depending on the changes done to the database structure,
the upgrade process will take more or less time and may need some space in /tmp
for temporary data. The upgrade can also require some more space in the
directory containing the database file.

Before running the new server version, make sure you have done your backups and
checked your disk space.

Some upgrades can also trigger a full rescan to rebuild parts of the database,
so startup will be a bit slower and more resource-intensive than usual.
