# OwnTone

TEST

OwnTone is a media server that lets you play audio sources such as local files,
Spotify, pipe input or internet radio to AirPlay 1 and 2 receivers, Chromecast
receivers, Roku Soundbridge, a browser or the server’s own sound system. Or you
can listen to your music via any client that supports mp3 streaming.

You control the server via a web interface, Apple Remote, an Android remote
(e.g. Retune), an MPD client, json API or DACP.

OwnTone also serves local files via the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP) to
iTunes (Windows), Apple Music (macOS) and Rhythmbox (Linux), and via the Roku
Server Protocol (RSP) to Roku devices.

Runs on Linux, BSD and macOS.

OwnTone was previously called forked-daapd, which again was a rewrite of
mt-daapd (Firefly Media Server).
