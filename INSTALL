Quick version for Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)
-----------------------------------------

See the instructions here:
http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=49928


Quick version for Debian/Ubuntu users
-------------------------------------

If you are the lucky kind, this should get you all the required tools and
libraries:

 sudo apt-get install \
  build-essential git autotools-dev autoconf libtool gettext gawk gperf \
  antlr3 libantlr3c-dev libconfuse-dev libunistring-dev libsqlite3-dev \
  libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev \
  libasound2-dev libmxml-dev libgcrypt11-dev libavahi-client-dev zlib1g-dev \
  libevent-dev libplist-dev libsodium-dev libjson-c-dev libwebsockets-dev

Optional packages:

 Feature             | Configure argument     | Packages
 --------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------
 Chromecast          | --enable-chromecast    | libgnutls-dev libprotobuf-c-dev
 LastFM              | --enable-lastfm        | libcurl4-[gnutls|openssl]-dev
 Spotify             | --enable-spotify       | libcurl4-[gnutls|openssl]-dev libspotify-dev
 iTunes XML          | --disable-itunes       | libplist-dev
 Device verification | --disable-verification | libplist-dev libsodium-dev
 Player web UI       | --disable-webinterface | libwebsockets-dev
 Live web UI         | --with-libwebsockets   | libwebsockets-dev
 Pulseaudio          | --with-pulseaudio      | libpulse-dev

Note that while forked-daapd will work with versions of libevent between 2.0.0
and 2.1.3, it is recommended to use 2.1.4+. Otherwise you may not have support
for Shoutcast metadata and simultaneous streaming to multiple clients.

Then run the following (adding configure arguments for optional features):

 git clone https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd.git
 cd forked-daapd
 autoreconf -i
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
 make
 sudo make install

Finally, read the section 'Long version - after installation' in the bottom of
this document, which describes configuration, setting up init scripts and adding
a system user. Also see the README for usage information.


Quick version for Fedora
------------------------

If you haven't already enabled the free RPM fusion packages do that, since you
will need ffmpeg. You can google how to do that. Then run:

sudo yum install \
 git automake autoconf gettext-devel gperf gawk libtool \
 sqlite-devel libconfuse-devel libunistring-devel mxml-devel libevent-devel \
 avahi-devel libgcrypt-devel zlib-devel alsa-lib-devel ffmpeg-devel \
 libplist-devel libsodium-devel json-c-devel libwebsockets-devel

Clone the forked-daapd repo:

 git clone https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd.git
 cd forked-daapd

Now you need to install ANTLR3, but you probably can't use the version that
comes with the package manager (but do try that first). Instead you can install
it by running this script:

 scripts/antlr35_install.sh

Then run the following:

 autoreconf -i
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
 make
 sudo make install

Finally, read the section 'Long version - after installation' in the bottom of
this document, which describes configuration, setting up init scripts and adding
a system user. Also see the README for usage information.


Quick version for FreeBSD
-------------------------

The build process for FreeBSD is rather complicated, but the good news is that
there is a script in the 'scripts' folder that will at least attempt to do all
the work for you. And should the script not work for you, you can still look
through it and use it as an installation guide.


"Quick" version for macOS (using macports)
------------------------------------------

Caution: macports requires many downloads and lots of time to install
(and sometimes build) ports... you'll want a decent network connection
and some patience!

Install macports (which requires Xcode):
  https://www.macports.org/install.php

Install Apple's Java (this enables java command on OSX 10.7+):
  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US

Afterwards, you can optionally install Oracle's newer version, and then
  choose it using the Java pref in the System Preferences:
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

sudo port install \
  autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig git gperf libgcrypt \
  libunistring libconfuse ffmpeg libevent json-c libwebsockets

Download, configure, build and install the Mini-XML library:
  http://www.msweet.org/projects.php/Mini-XML

Download, configure, build and install the libinotify library:
  https://github.com/libinotify-kqueue/libinotify-kqueue

Add the following to .bashrc:
  # add /usr/local to pkg-config path
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig
  # libunistring doesn't support pkg-config, set overrides
  export LIBUNISTRING_CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
  export LIBUNISTRING_LIBS="-L/opt/local/lib -lunistring"

Optional features require the following additional ports:

 Feature             | Configure argument     | Ports
 --------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------
 Chromecast          | --enable-chromecast    | gnutls protobuf-c
 LastFM              | --enable-lastfm        | curl
 iTunes XML          | --disable-itunes       | libplist
 Device verification | --disable-verification | libplist libsodium
 Pulseaudio          | --with-pulseaudio      | pulseaudio

Clone the forked-daapd repo:
  git clone https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd.git
  cd forked-daapd

Install antlr3 and library using the included script:
  scripts/antlr35_install.sh -p /usr/local

Finally, configure, build and install, adding configure arguments for
  optional features:

 autoreconf -i
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Note: if for some reason you've installed the avahi port, you need to
  add '--without-avahi' to configure above.

Edit /usr/local/etc/forked-daapd.conf and change the 'uid' to a nice
system daemon (eg: unknown), and run the following:
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/run
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/log # or change logfile in conf
  sudo chown unknown /usr/local/var/cache/forked-daapd # or change conf

Run forked-daapd:
  sudo /usr/local/sbin/forked-daapd

Verify it's running (you need to Ctrl-C to stop dns-sd):
  dns-sd -B _daap._tcp

Long version - requirements
---------------------------

Required tools:
 - ANTLR v3 is required to build forked-daapd, along with its C runtime
   (libantlr3c). Use a version between 3.1.3 and 3.5 of ANTLR v3 and the
   matching C runtime version. Get it from <http://www.antlr3.org/>

 - Java runtime: ANTLR is written in Java and as such a JRE is required to
   run the tool. The JRE is enough, you don't need a full JDK.

 - autotools: autoconf 2.63+, automake 1.10+, libtool 2.2. Run autoreconf -i
   at the top of the source tree to generate the build system.

 - gettext: libunistring requires iconv and gettext provides the autotools
   macro definitions for iconv.

 - gperf

If using binary packages, remember that you need the development packages to
build forked-daapd (usually named -dev or -devel).

sqlite3 needs to be built with support for the unlock notify API; this isn't
always the case in binary packages, so you may need to rebuild sqlite3 to
enable the unlock notify API (you can check for the presence of the
sqlite3_unlock_notify symbol in the sqlite3 library). Refer to the sqlite3
documentation, look for SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY.

libav (or ffmpeg) is a central piece of forked-daapd and most other FLOSS
multimedia applications. The version of libav you use will potentially have a
great influence on your experience with forked-daapd.


Long version - building and installing
--------------------------------------

Start by generating the build system by running autoreconf -i. This will
generate the configure script and Makefile.in.

The configure script will look for a wrapper called antlr3 in the PATH to
invoke ANTLR3. If your installation of ANTLR3 does not come with such a
wrapper, create one as follows:

  #!/bin/sh
  CLASSPATH=...
  exec /path/to/java -cp $CLASSPATH org.antlr.Tool "@"

Adjust the CLASSPATH as needed so that Java will find all the jars needed
by ANTLR3.

The parsers will be generated during the build, no manual intervention is
needed.

To display the configure options run ./configure --help

Support for Spotify is optional. Use --enable-spotify to enable this feature.
If you enable this feature libspotify/api.h is required at compile time.
Forked-daapd uses runtime dynamic linking to the libspotify library, so even
though you compiled with --enable-spotify, the executable will still be able
to run on systems without libspotify (the Spotify features will then be 
disabled).

Support for LastFM scrobbling is optional. Use --enable-lastfm to enable this
feature.

Support for iTunes Music Library XML format is optional. Use --disable-itunes
to disable this feature.

Support for the MPD protocol is optional. Use --disable-mpd to disable this
feature.

Support for Apple TV device verification is optional. Use --disable-verification
to disable this feature.

Support for Chromecast devices is optional. Use --enable-chromecast to enable
this feature.

The player web interface is optional. Use --disable-webinterface to disable
this feature.
If enabled, 'sudo make install' will install the prebuild html, js, css files.
The prebuild files are:
- htdocs/index.html
- htdocs/player/*
The source for the player web interface is located under the web-src folder and
requires nodejs >= 6.0 to be built. In the web-src folder run 'npm install' to
install all dependencies for the player web interface. After that run 'npm run build'.
This will build the web interface and update the htdocs folder. 
(See README_PLAYER_WEBINTERFACE.md for more informations)

Building with libwebsockets is optional, but required if you want the player
web interface (so not required for the admin web interface, where websockets
only improve the UI). It will be enabled if the library is present (with
headers). Use --without-libwebsockets to disable.

Building with Pulseaudio is optional. It will be enabled if the library is
present (with headers). Use --without-pulseaudio to disable.

Recommended build settings:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var

After configure run the usual make, and if that went well, 'sudo make install'

You may see two kinds of warnings during make.
First, /usr/bin/antlr3 may generate a long series of warnings that
begin like this:
  warning(24):  template error: context ...
  
Second, you may see compiler warnings that look like this:
  RSPLexer.c: In function `mESCAPED':
  RSPLexer.c:2674:16: warning: unused variable `_type' [-Wunused-variable]
    ANTLR3_UINT32 _type;
                  ^~~~~                  
You can safely ignore all of these warnings.

Long version - after installation
---------------------------------

After installation, edit the configuration file, /etc/forked-daapd.conf.

Note that 'sudo make install' will not install any system files to start the
service after boot, and it will not setup a system user.

forked-daapd will drop privileges to any user you'll specify in the
configuration file if it's started as root.

This user must have read permission on your library (you can create a group for
this and make the user a member of the group, for instance) and read/write
permissions on the database location ($localstatedir/cache/forked-daapd by
default).

If your system uses systemd then you might be able to use the service file
included, see forked-daapd.service.

Otherwise you might need an init script to start forked-daapd at boot. A simple
init script will do, forked-daapd daemonizes all by itself and creates a
pidfile under /var/run. Different distributions have different standards for
init scripts and some do not use init scripts anymore; check the documentation
for your distribution.

For dependency-based boot systems, here are the forked-daapd dependencies:
 - local filesystems
 - network filesystems, if needed in your setup (library on NFS, ...)
 - networking
 - NTP
 - Avahi daemon
