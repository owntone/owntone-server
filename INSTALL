Installation instructions for forked-daapd
------------------------------------------

This document contains instructions for installing forked-daapd from the git
tree.

The source for this version of forked-daapd can be found here:

  <https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd.git>

The original (now unmaintained) source can be found here:

  <http://git.debian.org/?p=users/jblache/forked-daapd.git>


Quick version for Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)
-----------------------------------------

See the instructions here:
http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=49928


Quick version for Debian/Ubuntu users
-------------------------------------

If you are the lucky kind, this should get you all the required tools and
libraries:

 sudo apt-get install \
  build-essential git autotools-dev autoconf libtool gettext gawk gperf \
  antlr3 libantlr3c-dev libconfuse-dev libunistring-dev libsqlite3-dev \
  libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev \
  libasound2-dev libmxml-dev libgcrypt11-dev libavahi-client-dev zlib1g-dev \
  libevent-dev

Optional packages:

 Feature    | Configure argument  | Packages
 -----------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------
 Chromecast | --enable-chromecast | libjson-c-dev libgnutls-dev libprotobuf-c-dev
 LastFM     | --enable-lastfm     | libcurl4-gnutls-dev OR libcurl4-openssl-dev
 iTunes XML | --enable-itunes     | libplist-dev
 Pulseaudio | --with-pulseaudio   | libpulse-dev

Note that while forked-daapd will work with versions of libevent between 2.0.0
and 2.1.3, it is recommended to use 2.1.4+. Otherwise you may not have support
for Shoutcast metadata and simultaneous streaming to multiple clients.

Then run the following (adding configure arguments for optional features):

 git clone https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd.git
 cd forked-daapd
 autoreconf -i
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
 make
 sudo make install

Finally, read the bit in the bottom of this document about init scripts, read
the README, edit the configuration file and restart the server.


Quick version for Fedora
------------------------

If you haven't already enabled the free RPM fusion packages do that, since you
will need ffmpeg. You can google how to do that. Then run:

sudo yum install \
 git automake autoconf gettext-devel gperf gawk libtool \
 sqlite-devel libconfuse-devel libunistring-devel mxml-devel libevent-devel \
 avahi-devel libgcrypt-devel zlib-devel alsa-lib-devel ffmpeg-devel

Clone the forked-daapd repo:

 git clone https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd.git
 cd forked-daapd

Now you need to install ANTLR3, but you probably can't use the version that
comes with the package manager (but do try that first). Instead you can install
it by running this script:

 scripts/antlr35_install.sh

Then run the following:

 autoreconf -i
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
 make
 sudo make install

Finally, read the bit in the bottom of this document about init scripts, read
the README, edit the configuration file and start the server.


Quick version for FreeBSD
-------------------------

The build process for FreeBSD is rather complicated, but the good news is that
there is a script in the 'scripts' folder that will at least attempt to do all
the work for you. And should the script not work for you, you can still look
through it and use it as an installation guide.



Long version - requirements
---------------------------

Required tools:
 - ANTLR v3 is required to build forked-daapd, along with its C runtime
   (libantlr3c). Use a version between 3.1.3 and 3.5 of ANTLR v3 and the
   matching C runtime version. Get it from <http://www.antlr3.org/>

 - Java runtime: ANTLR is written in Java and as such a JRE is required to
   run the tool. The JRE is enough, you don't need a full JDK.

 - autotools: autoconf 2.63+, automake 1.10+, libtool 2.2. Run autoreconf -i
   at the top of the source tree to generate the build system.

 - gettext: libunistring requires iconv and gettext provides the autotools
   macro definitions for iconv.

 - gperf


Libraries:
 - libantlr3c (ANTLR3 C runtime, use the same version as antlr3)
        from <https://github.com/antlr/website-antlr3/tree/gh-pages/download/C>
 - Avahi client libraries (avahi-client), 0.6.24 minimum
        from <http://avahi.org/>
 - sqlite3 3.5.0+ with unlock notify API enabled (read below)
        from <http://sqlite.org/download.html>
 - libav 9+ or ffmpeg 0.11+
        from <http://libav.org/> or <http://ffmpeg.org/>
 - libconfuse
        from <http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/>
 - libevent 2.0+ (best with 2.1.4+)
        from <http://libevent.org/>
 - MiniXML (aka mxml or libmxml)
        from <http://minixml.org/software.php>
 - gcrypt 1.2.0+
        from <http://gnupg.org/download/index.en.html#libgcrypt>
 - zlib
        from <http://zlib.net/>
 - libunistring 0.9.3+
        from <http://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/#downloading>
 - libasound (optional - ALSA local audio)
	often already installed as part of your distro
 - libpulse (optional - Pulseaudio local audio)
        from <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Download/>
 - libplist 0.16+ (optional - iTunes XML support)
        from <http://github.com/JonathanBeck/libplist/downloads>
 - libspotify (optional - Spotify support)
        from <https://developer.spotify.com>
 - libcurl (optional - LastFM support)
        from <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>
 - libjson-c (optional - Chromecast support)
        from <https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki>
 - libgnutls (optional - Chromecast support)
        from <http://www.gnutls.org/>
 - libprotobuf-c (optional - Chromecast support)
        from <https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/wiki>

If using binary packages, remember that you need the development packages to
build forked-daapd (usually named -dev or -devel).

sqlite3 needs to be built with support for the unlock notify API; this isn't
always the case in binary packages, so you may need to rebuild sqlite3 to
enable the unlock notify API (you can check for the presence of the
sqlite3_unlock_notify symbol in the sqlite3 library). Refer to the sqlite3
documentation, look for SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY.

libav (or ffmpeg) is a central piece of forked-daapd and most other FLOSS
multimedia applications. The version of libav you use will potentially have a
great influence on your experience with forked-daapd.


Long version - building and installing
--------------------------------------

Start by generating the build system by running autoreconf -i. This will
generate the configure script and Makefile.in.

The configure script will look for a wrapper called antlr3 in the PATH to
invoke ANTLR3. If your installation of ANTLR3 does not come with such a
wrapper, create one as follows:

  #!/bin/sh
  CLASSPATH=...
  exec /path/to/java -cp $CLASSPATH org.antlr.Tool "@"

Adjust the CLASSPATH as needed so that Java will find all the jars needed
by ANTLR3.

The parsers will be generated during the build, no manual intervention is
needed.

To display the configure options run ./configure --help

Support for Spotify is optional. Use --enable-spotify to enable this feature.
If you enable this feature libspotify/api.h is required at compile time.
Forked-daapd uses runtime dynamic linking to the libspotify library, so even
though you compiled with --enable-spotify, the executable will still be able
to run on systems without libspotify (the Spotify features will then be 
disabled).

Support for LastFM scrobbling is optional. Use --enable-lastfm to enable this
feature.

Support for iTunes Music Library XML format is optional. Use --enable-itunes
to enable this feature.

Support for the MPD protocol is optional. Use --disable-mpd to disable this
feature.

Support for Chromecast devices is optional. Use --enable-chromecast to enable
this feature.

Building with Pulseaudio is optional. Use --with-pulseaudio to enable.

Recommended build settings:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var

After configure run the usual make, and if that went well, sudo make install


Long version - after installation
---------------------------------

After installation, edit the configuration file, /etc/forked-daapd.conf and
adjust the values at your convenience.

forked-daapd will drop privileges to any user you'll specify in the
configuration file if it's started as root.

This user must have read permission on your library (you can create a group for
this and make the user a member of the group, for instance) and read/write
permissions on the database location ($localstatedir/cache/forked-daapd by
default).

If your system uses systemd then you might be able to use the service file
included, see forked-daapd.service.

Otherwise you might need an init script to start forked-daapd at boot. A simple
init script will do, forked-daapd daemonizes all by itself and creates a
pidfile under /var/run. Different distributions have different standards for
init scripts and some do not use init scripts anymore; check the documentation
for your distribution.

For dependency-based boot systems, here are the forked-daapd dependencies:
 - local filesystems
 - network filesystems, if needed in your setup (library on NFS, ...)
 - networking
 - NTP
 - Avahi daemon
